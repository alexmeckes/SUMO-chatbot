Firefox’s recommendations team works with custom machine learning algorithms to surface the most compelling content from around the web, drawing on a wide array of sources with a track record of trustworthy and accurate coverage.\n</p>\n<h1 id=\"w_are-these-stories-on-the-new-tab-page-personalized-to-me\">Are these stories on the New Tab page personalized to me?</h1>\n<p>For the most part, no. Most recommendations on your New Tab page come from a general list of the best stories on the web. But Firefox is actively working on ways to deliver personalized recommendations in a way that vigorously protects users’ privacy. Importantly, <strong>Mozilla never receives a copy of your browser history</strong>. When personalization does occur, recommendations rely on a process of story sorting and filtering that happens locally in your personal copy of Firefox.\n</p>\n<h1 id=\"w_what-information-is-collected-when-i-interact-with-recommended-stories\">What information is collected when I interact with Recommended stories?</h1>\n<p>By default, when stories recommended by Firefox are displayed on your <a href=\"/en-US/kb/about-new-tab-page\">New Tab page</a>, we collect information about how many times they appear and how many times they are clicked. You can learn more about <a href=\"https://github.com/mozilla/activity-stream/blob/master/docs/v2-system-addon/data_events.md\">the data we collect</a> and you can <a href=\"/en-US/kb/manage-firefox-data-collection-privacy-settings\">opt out of data collection</a>.\n</p>\n<h1 id=\"w_why-do-some-new-recommended-stories-have-a-sponsored-by-label\">Why do some new Recommended stories have a “sponsored by” label?</h1>\n<p>Firefox partners with select publishers and brands to deliver high-quality sponsored content and advertisements to our users. This content will always be clearly marked, and you have control over whether it is shown on your New Tab page.\n</p><p>If you prefer to not see a sponsored story on your New Tab page, you can easily dismiss it by selecting the three-dot button next to the recommendations and clicking <span class=\"menu\">Dismiss</span>. You can also permanently opt-out of viewing sponsored stories by following the instructions <a href=\"/en-US/kb/sponsor-privacy\">here</a>.\n</p>\n<h1 id=\"w_do-sponsors-receive-data-about-me-when-i-look-at-these-stories\">Do sponsors receive data about me when I look at these stories?</h1>\n<p>Your privacy is of the utmost importance to us.

We do not collect personally identifying data through these interactions, nor do we share it with our sponsors.\n</p>\n<h1 id=\"w_why-do-i-see-stories-with-publication-dates-that-arent-from-today\">Why do I see stories with publication dates that aren’t from today?</h1>\n<p>Many stories remain relevant beyond 24 hours.
