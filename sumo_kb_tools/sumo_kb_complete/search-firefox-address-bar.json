For more information on using alternative search engines, see Change your default search settings in Firefox . Search suggestions Firefox suggests relevant search terms and even solutions related to the answer or task you may be looking for. Here are some examples of search suggestions. Keyword suggestions When you start typing in the address bar, Firefox suggests relevant popular searches provided by search engines like Google, Bing, etc. When search suggestions are enabled, the text you type is sent to the default search engine, which analyzes the words and displays a list of related searches. Note: You can change your search settings to use your favorite search engine as the default or turn search suggestions on or off. To learn more, see Change your default search settings in Firefox and Search suggestions in Firefox . Write a ? before your input (for example: ?mozilla support ) if you want to see only search suggestions, or if you want to see search suggestions although the setting Show search suggestions in address bar results is disabled (but the setting Provide search suggestions has to be enabled). When you are using a search shortcut, the keyword suggestions come from the chosen search engine. Smart keywords do not make keyword suggestions. Site suggestions As you type into the address bar, Firefox may offer relevant site suggestions, such as websites from your browsing history, bookmarks and open tabs, to help you quickly and easily navigate the web. To learn more, see Address bar autocomplete suggestions in Firefox . URL autocomplete As you type a web address or search term in the address bar, the URL autocomplete feature automatically finishes what you’re typing based on matching websites in your bookmarks, history or popular websites.

Your data stays on your device and is not sent to Mozilla or another organization. This is an experiment at the present time, in Firefox version 141. If you wish to turn off this feature: Type about:studies in the address bar and press Enter Return . If you're part of the experiment, you'll find a Semantic History Search entry under Active studies . Click the Remove button next to Semantic History Search and then close the tab.",
