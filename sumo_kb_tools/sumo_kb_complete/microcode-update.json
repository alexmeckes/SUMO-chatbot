On Mac, to have an up-to-date system, apply all OS X system updates and Apple firmware updates offered in the Updates pane of the App Store app. To allow Windows to load updated microcode onto the CPU, make sure Windows Update is enabled and set to install updates. To see the processor microarchitecture and which microcode revision is in use, run the command reg query HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\HARDWARE\\DESCRIPTION\\System\\CentralProcessor\\0 in the Windows command prompt.

Whether microcode updates are in use by default depends on the Linux distribution and can differ for Intel and AMD CPUs. On Debian-based distributions, including Ubuntu, microcode updates for Intel processors are provided by the intel-microcode package and microcode updates for AMD processors are provided by the amd64-microcode package. On Arch, AMD microcode updates are installed by default, but Intel microcode updates require special steps . On Fedora, microcode updates are installed by default.
