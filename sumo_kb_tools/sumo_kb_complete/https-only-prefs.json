It is the fundamental protocol for the web and encodes basic interactions between browsers and web servers. The problem with the regular HTTP protocol is that the data transferring from server to browser is not encrypted, meaning data can be viewed, stolen or altered. <a href=\"https://wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTPS\">HTTPS</a> protocols fix this by using a Transport Layer Security (TLS) certificate. This creates a secure encrypted connection between the server and the browser, which protects sensitive information.\n</p>\n<h1 id=\"w_about-https-only-mode\">About HTTPS-Only Mode</h1>\n<p>When you use HTTPS-Only Mode, this ensures all of your connections are encrypted and secure. So you have peace of mind that no one can snoop on the content of the pages you visit or hack into your connection to a website to steal your passwords, credit card information or other personal information. This is especially useful when you are using a public Wi-Fi, where you can’t be sure of the integrity of your internet connection.\n</p><p>For example, when HTTPS-Only Mode is active and a site is visited such as <code>http://example.com</code>, Firefox will silently upgrade to <code>https://example.com</code>:\n</p>\n<dl><dt><img alt=\"ConnectionUpgradeExample\" class=\"wiki-image frameless lazy\" data-original-src=\"https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/media/uploads/gallery/images/2020-10-27-12-10-49-c7901b.gif\" src=\"https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/static/placeholder.688345f843bb37ed.gif\" title=\"\">\n</dt></dl>\n<h1 id=\"w_enabledisable-https-only-mode\">Enable/Disable HTTPS-Only Mode</h1>\n<ol><li><span class=\"for\" data-for=\"mac\">In the Menu bar at the top of the screen, click <span class=\"menu\">Firefox</span> and then select <span class=\"menu\">Preferences</span> or <span class=\"menu\">Settings</span>, depending on your macOS version.</span><span class=\"for\" data-for=\"win,linux\">Click the menu button <img alt=\"Fx89menuButton\" class=\"wiki-image frameless lazy\" data-original-src=\"https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/media/uploads/gallery/images/2021-05-15-11-18-38-e5b736.png\" src=\"https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/static/placeholder.688345f843bb37ed.gif\" title=\"\"> and select <span class=\"menu\">Settings</span>.</span>\n\n</li><li>Select <span class=\"menu\">Privacy &amp; Security</span> from the left menu.\n</li><li>Scroll down to <em>HTTPS-Only Mode</em>.\n</li><li>Use the radio button to select whether to enable or disable HTTPS-Only Mode, or select to only enable it for <a href=\"/en-US/kb/private-browsing-use-firefox-without-history\">private windows</a>.\n<dl><dt><span class=\"for\" data-for=\"not fx135\"><img alt=\"Fx90HTTPS-OnlyModeSettings\" class=\"wiki-image frameless lazy\" data-original-src=\"https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/media/uploads/gallery/images/2021-07-26-15-12-54-a011a8.png\" src=\"https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/static/placeholder.688345f843bb37ed.gif\" title=\"\"></span><span class=\"for\" data-for=\"=fx135\"><img alt=\"Fx135settings-HTTPSOnlyMode\" class=\"wiki-image frameless lazy\" data-original-src=\"https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/media/uploads/gallery/images/2025-02-18-03-59-18-6bed2f.png\" src=\"https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/static/placeholder.688345f843bb37ed.gif\" title=\"\"></span><span class=\"for\" data-for=\"fx136\"><img alt=\"Fx136settings-HTTPSOnlyMode\" class=\"wiki-image frameless lazy\" data-original-src=\"https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/media/uploads/gallery/images/2025-02-18-04-00-22-679da9.png\" src=\"https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/static/placeholder.688345f843bb37ed.gif\" title=\"\"></span>\n</dt></dl>\n</li></ol>\n<p>To learn more about upgrades to secure connections, see <a href=\"/en-US/kb/https-upgrades\">Firefox connection upgrades - HTTP to HTTPS</a>.\n</p>\n<h1 id=\"w_secure-site-not-available-page\">“Secure Site Not Available” page</h1>\n<p>Some websites only support HTTP and the connection cannot be upgraded.
