The small language model that powers this feature is downloaded locally to your device. This means that your PDF and image content stays private on your device and is never sent to a remote server.

This is so people reading the alt text with a screen reader or directly on the PDF can be informed that the alt text was not human-generated. For example: “Created automatically: [alt text description will go here]”.\n</p><p>If a user has manually edited the automatic alt text, the disclaimer will disappear.\n</p>\n<h2 id=\"w_can-i-skip-adding-alt-text\">Can I skip adding alt text?</h2>\n<p>Yes.

This is because our automatic alt text should receive a human review to ensure quality. If the image doesn’t have any alt text, you will see a button that says <span class=\"button\">Missing alt text</span>.

These include programming the model not to use offensive language or assume race, ethnicity, religion, gender or health status of people depicted in an image.\n</p><p>Although good alt text conveys the meaning of an image and its content, the small language model that powers this feature cannot provide nuanced meaning or place the image in the appropriate historic or cultural content the way a human can.

Our small language model is still a work in progress, and it will make mistakes, especially when describing complex images. This is why we designed the feature to: Encourage human review so that our users can correct inaccuracies and include any missing details before saving the alt text. Provide guardrails and notify screen reader users up front if alt text was automatically generated. This allows screen reader users to decide if they want to read or skip the description, with the understanding that automatic descriptions may be less accurate than descriptions written by a human. To report issues with automatically generated content, please create tickets here . Can automatic alt text generate overly descriptive or complex content? Good alt text should be short and use simple words. That’s why we’ve trained our model to produce very brief descriptions that use plain language as much as possible. Can the automatic alt text be too vague or miss key details? Because we are aiming for short descriptions, it is possible for the text to be lacking in detail. This is why we encourage human review of all automatically generated alt text, so that our users can add the proper context and details as needed. Is automatic alt text private? Yes. The small language model that powers this feature is downloaded locally to your device. This means that your PDF and image content stays private on your device and is never sent to a remote server. The content of your PDF, image and alt text will never be viewable by Mozilla. Is any PDF or image data used to train the alt text model? No. None of your PDF or image data leaves your device, and your data will never be used to train the alt text model. How do I turn off automatic alt text? From the alt text editor, you can turn the Create alt text automatically toggle off to turn off the feature. Or, you can access image alt text settings from the PDF overflow menu and turn off the toggle from there. On this settings screen, you can also delete the model from your device. How do I know when alt text is automatically generated? When you see the text This alt text was created automatically below the text box on the alt text editor, you’ll know that the alt text was generated using our model. Users who are reading the PDF outside of the Firefox editor will experience a disclaimer that comes before the alt text. This is so people reading the alt text with a screen reader or directly on the PDF can be informed that the alt text was not human-generated. For example: “Created automatically: [alt text description will go here]”. If a user has manually edited the automatic alt text, the disclaimer will disappear. Can I skip adding alt text? Yes. After adding an image, you can click Not now on the alt text editor. This will discard any changes you have made to the alt text. If you do this, you may see a button on the image that says Review alt text . This is because our automatic alt text should receive a human review to ensure quality. If the image doesn’t have any alt text, you will see a button that says Missing alt text . You can click this button at any time and click Save after reviewing, adding or editing the alt text as needed. If you no longer wish to see the alt text editor after adding an image, open image alt text settings from the PDF overflow menu and turn off this setting. Will alt text appear in a printed PDF? No, alt text only appears on a digital PDF, where it can be viewed by hovering over the image or read by a screen reader. Can automatic alt text generate biased, inappropriate or offensive content? We’ve taken several steps to reduce the risk that the alt text model will generate biased, inappropriate or offensive content. These include programming the model not to use offensive language or assume race, ethnicity, religion, gender or health status of people depicted in an image. Although good alt text conveys the meaning of an image and its content, the small language model that powers this feature cannot provide nuanced meaning or place the image in the appropriate historic or cultural content the way a human can. However, our model is designed to create a first draft of alt text that our users can edit as needed to convey the meaning of the image properly. By providing this starting point and encouraging human review, we are helping users produce alt text that meets established best practices more quickly.
