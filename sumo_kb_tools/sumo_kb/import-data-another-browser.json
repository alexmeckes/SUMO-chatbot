  "content": "Firefox lets you import bookmarks from other browsers installed on your computer. It also lets you import other data, such as browsing history and saved passwords, from some of these browsers. If you have logins and passwords stored in another browser, sometimes Firefox will suggest importing that login data into Firefox, to help you log in to a website. Note: Firefox does not save or sync login data from another browser unless you choose to import it. This data is stored locally in a readable form on your computer by the other browser.

From here, you can choose the browser, profile, and data you wish to import ( see below ). Import from the Library window You can import data from another browser into Firefox from the Bookmarks Library window: Click the Firefox menu button to open the menu panel.

The import will start. You may be prompted to add your system password to proceed. All set! Click Done to wrap up the import. The import process will transfer the selected data to Firefox, for example: Saved passwords: Your saved usernames and passwords. Bookmarks: Web pages you have saved in your bookmarks. Browsing history: Information on the sites you have visited. Extensions: Google Chrome extensions that match similar Firefox versions. Form autofill data: Information you use to populate online forms. Note: You won’t be able to import payment methods from Chrome on Windows to Firefox anymore, as the capability will no longer be supported due to changes in Chrome’s encryption mechanism. Afterward, the Firefox Bookmarks menu or Bookmarks Toolbar will include the bookmarks imported from the other browser. The Bookmarks toolbar will automatically appear to help you easily find your newly imported bookmarks. Note: If the Import Wizard does not list your other browser, you can still import bookmarks from that browser, but you will need to first export and save the bookmarks as an HTML file (visit the support site for your other browser if you need help with that). You can then import those bookmarks into Firefox from the HTML file. Import passwords from Chrome with the CSV file via the migration wizard Note: You'll no longer be able to import passwords from Chrome to Firefox automatically on Windows. You’ll have to import them using a CSV file via the migration wizard. You’ll need to export the CSV file containing your passwords from Chrome. Open Chrome , then the main menu , and go to Passwords and Autofill > Google Passwords Manager . Select Settings from the menu. Next to Export passwords , click Download file , and save the CSV file to your device. Then, import the CSV file using the methods explained above . Please be aware that while the issue will be broadly applicable to all Firefox versions, for now we're only updating the Firefox UI starting in Firefox version 139 (English locales only) and version 140 (all locales) to reflect the change.
