Note: The Payment methods option enables you to import payment methods saved in Chrome to Firefox. You won’t be able to import payment methods from Chrome on Windows to Firefox anymore, as the capability will no longer be supported due to changes in Chrome’s encryption mechanism. All set! Click Done to wrap up the import. The import process will transfer the selected data to Firefox, such as: Saved passwords: Your saved usernames and passwords. Bookmarks: Web pages you have saved in your bookmarks. Browsing history: Information on the sites you have visited. Extensions: Chrome extensions that match similar Firefox versions. Form autofill data: Information you use to populate online forms. Note: Extensions can be imported starting in Firefox version 116.

Import passwords from Chrome with the CSV file via the migration wizard Note: You are not able to import passwords from Chrome to Firefox automatically on Windows or Linux.

Please be aware that while the issue will be broadly applicable to all Firefox versions, for now we're only updating the Firefox UI starting in Firefox version 139 (English locales only) and version 140 (all locales) to reflect the change.
