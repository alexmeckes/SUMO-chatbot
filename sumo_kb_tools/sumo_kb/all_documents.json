To allow media autoplay, see Allow or block media autoplay in Firefox . You may need to install the required PulseAudio software If you see a notification saying “ To play audio, you may need to install the required PulseAudio software ”, it means that Firefox cannot find or use PulseAudio. The PulseAudio software is required to play any audio from Firefox. Most Linux distributions now come with PulseAudio pre-installed. Use your system's software package manager and ensure that PulseAudio is correctly installed. HTML5 audio and video Firefox has built in support for open media formats usually associated with MP3, WebM, Ogg, and Wave containers. However, MP4 containers usually depend on platform decoders for AAC and H.264 audio and video streams. For more information, see Audio and video files in Firefox .
