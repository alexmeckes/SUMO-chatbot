Check the Volume Mixer and make sure the volume level for Mozilla Firefox is not low or muted. Reload the website Sometimes a change you make in the system settings, such as selecting another sound device in the Volume Mixer , may not be applied correctly in an already open tab. Try reloading the website to see if it solves the issue. Allow autoplay of media with sound Firefox may be blocking media with sound from playing automatically. To allow media autoplay, see Allow or block media autoplay in Firefox .
