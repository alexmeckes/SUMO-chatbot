# Check volume control for Firefox in the Volume Mixer


The Volume Mixer has a specific volume control for Firefox.[Check the Volume Mixer]and make sure the volume level for*Mozilla Firefox*is not low or muted.[VolumeMixer-Win7][Win10 Volume Mixer]

# Reload the website


Sometimes a change you make in the system settings, such as selecting another sound device in the Volume Mixer, may not be applied correctly in an already open tab. Try reloading the website to see if it solves the issue.

# Allow autoplay of media with sound


Firefox may be blocking media with sound from playing automatically. To allow media autoplay, see[Allow or block media autoplay in Firefox].

# You may need to install the required PulseAudio software


If you see a notification saying “*To play audio, you may need to install the required PulseAudio software*”, it means that Firefox cannot find or use PulseAudio. The[PulseAudio software]is required to play any audio from Firefox. Most Linux distributions now come with PulseAudio pre-installed.

Use your system's software package manager and ensure that PulseAudio is correctly installed.

# HTML5 audio and video


Firefox has built in support for open media formats usually associated with MP3, WebM, Ogg, and Wave containers. However, MP4 containers usually depend on platform decoders for AAC and H.264 audio and video streams. For more information, see[Audio and video files in Firefox].

# You may need the latest Media Feature Pack for N versions of Windows


Windows N versions are missing Windows Media Player and related software for media functions. You may need to install or update the Media Feature Pack from Microsoft. See[Fix video and audio problems on Firefox for Windows N editions]for details.

# Digital Rights Management (DRM) protected videos


If you have problems playing DRM-controlled content from Amazon Prime, Netflix, Hulu, Disney+ and other streaming services, make sure that your Firefox Settings
General panel**Digital Rights Management (DRM) Content**setting,*Play DRM-controlled content*is check marked and that the Google Widevine plugin is enabled. See[Watch DRM content on Firefox]for more information.
**Note:** **Note:**Google Widevine ended support for 32-bit Linux on May 31, 2021. Only 64-bit Linux is supported.
**Note:** **Note:**The current version of Google Widevine is no longer compatible with older Mac operating systems such as OS X 10.9 and 10.10. Only versions OS X 10.11 and above are supported.

# Clear the cache


See[How to clear the Firefox cache].

# Disable interfering extensions or ad-blocking software


Ad-blocking software, such as anti-banner filters of your Internet Security program, or extensions, such as uBlock Origin or Adblock Plus, can prevent audio or video content from playing.

• If the site works with ad-blocking disabled, you may want to add the site to your whitelist in your adblocker filter.
• If the video or audio plays when you disable all extensions, then one of your extensions was causing the problem. For more information, see[Troubleshoot extensions, themes and hardware acceleration issues to solve common Firefox problems].
