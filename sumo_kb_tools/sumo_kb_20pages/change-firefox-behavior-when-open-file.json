For example, Firefox may display the content as plain text instead of opening the file in an application. To learn more, see Properly configuring server MIME types and Common MIME types at MDN web docs. You can contact the website in such cases, or you can try a Firefox add-on such as Content-Type Fixer to work around the problem.

If Firefox does not have a set download action for a type of file, Firefox will save the file by default. If you select Always Open Similar Files in the Downloads panel right-click context menu for the file, ( see below ) a new Content Type and Action entry will be added to the General panel Applications section of Firefox settings.

The file will not be downloaded and the Downloads panel will not open. Instead, the file will open and play in Firefox, with a control bar displayed to manage playback (see Audio and video in Firefox for details). Firefox only uses Applications settings to determine what action is taken when a file is treated as a download ( see below ). Changing download actions You can change what action Firefox takes for defined content types. This will not affect media embedded in a web page – only links to the files themselves. In the Menu bar at the top of the screen, click Firefox and then select Preferences or Settings , depending on your macOS version. Click the menu button and select Settings . In the General panel, go to the Applications section. Select the Content Type entry for action you want to change. (You might see more than one entry for the same file format or extension because some types of files include multiple content types.) The Action column will give you a drop-down menu, with options on the action to take. Open in Firefox : Select this if you want Firefox to display the content. It only applies to a limited number of content types that Firefox is able to decode (PDF, AVIF, XML, SVG, and WebP Image). Always ask : This will show you a prompt asking What should Firefox do with this file? ( see below ) so that you can choose the action you want to take.

Adding download actions When you choose Ask whether to open or save files in Firefox settings under Applications (as shown above) and you download a file with no defined content type and action, you will see a What should Firefox do with this file? prompt. When you choose an action and also select the option, Do this automatically for files like this from now on , a new Content Type and Action entry will be added to the Applications list for that type of file.

When you download a type of file that can be opened with an installed application you can set Firefox to always open similar files as follows: Right-click Hold down the Control key while you click the downloaded item in the Downloads panel. (You can also do this from the Library window Downloads history .) Select Always Open Similar Files from the context menu. This option may be missing in some cases, such as for executable files or files served by the website with an incorrect content type ( see above ). \"Always Open Similar Files\" option When you select Always Open Similar Files from the context menu for a downloaded item, the file will open in the system default application and a new Content Type entry will be added to the Applications section of Firefox settings, with the download action set to use that application.
