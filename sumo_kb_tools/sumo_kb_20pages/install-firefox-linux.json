Select your desired profile. After this initial setup, the -P command will no longer be necessary. Install from your distribution package manager To install Firefox using your distribution package manager, please refer to your Linux distribution's documentation. This method is recommended because it ensures Firefox and all the required libraries are installed and configured optimally for your distribution.

Install Firefox from Mozilla builds Before you install Firefox from a Mozilla build, make sure that your computer has the required libraries installed. Missing or incompatible libraries may cause Firefox to be inoperable. System Firefox installation (for advanced users) To install Firefox with this method, you must be able to log in as root or execute sudo commands. This installation will have priority over the Firefox version installed through your package manager. To run the version installed with your package manager, you will need to execute the binary from a terminal. To do so in most distributions, open a terminal and type: /usr/bin/firefox Go to the Firefox download page , and click Download for Linux 32-bit or Download for Linux 64-bit . Open a terminal, and go to the folder where your download has been saved. For example: cd ~/Downloads Extract the contents of the downloaded file by typing: tar xjf firefox-*.tar.bz2 The following commands must be executed as root or preceded by sudo . Move the uncompressed Firefox folder to /opt : mv firefox /opt Create a symlink to the Firefox executable: ln -s /opt/firefox/firefox /usr/local/bin/firefox Download a copy of the desktop file: wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mozilla/sumo-kb/main/install-firefox-linux/firefox.desktop -P /usr/local/share/applications Alternatively, if wget is not installed on your computer, go to the URL mentioned above, right-click on the page to open the contextual menu, and select Save Page As . After you downloaded the file, move it to /usr/local/share/applications . To verify that the installation was successful, you can open the Troubleshooting Information page. In the Application Basics section, the value of the line Application Binary should be /opt/firefox/firefox-bin . Local Firefox installation in user's account If you don't have access to login as root or execute sudo commands, or just prefer to use a local Firefox in your account, you can make a local installation. You can also do this to have multiple Firefox installations for different builds. Go to the Firefox download page , and click the Download Now button. You can also click the Download a different platform or language link below that button to choose another build: Nightly, Beta, Developer or ESR. Open a terminal, and go to the folder where your download has been saved. For example: cd ~/Downloads Extract the downloaded file contents. This will create a folder named firefox . After that, you can delete the archive: tar xjf firefox-*.tar.bz2 rm firefox-*.tar.bz2 If you downloaded a specific build, you may want to rename the uncompressed folder accordingly. For example: mv firefox firefox-nightly You can leave the uncompressed folder into your download folder, or move it to another place in your account. For example: mv firefox ~/firefox Firefox is now ready to be used. You can run it directly from the terminal: ~/firefox/firefox & Create a desktop shortcut. (It may be different in your Linux distribution.) Right-click on the desktop, and choose Create launcher from the context menu. You can also type this on the terminal: ln -s ~/firefox/firefox ~/Desktop/ An icon for the desktop shortcut will be found in ~/firefox/browser/chrome/icons/default/ Note: This method doesn't change file types binding on the system, so links from other applications will not open in the local installation.
