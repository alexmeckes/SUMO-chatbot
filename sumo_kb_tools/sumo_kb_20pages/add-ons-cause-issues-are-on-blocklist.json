The action is intended to protect users from harm caused by security vulnerabilities, performance issues, or policy violations. There are two levels:\n</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Restricting:</strong> Used for other policy violations. Restricting disables the installed add-on, while allowing a user to accept the potential harm and manually re-enable the add-on. This approach ensures users have a choice, while giving developers time to address the identified issues before further action, such as a block, is taken in some cases.\n</li><li><strong>Blocking:</strong> This strict measure is applied to add-ons that pose significant risks to user safety, privacy, or browser performance. Blocking disables the installed add-on, preventing users from re-enabling it. This is typically reserved for severe cases, such as add-ons with critical security vulnerabilities or those that violate policies related to user privacy, such as search hijacking or the inability for Mozilla to review the add-on.\n</li></ul>\n<p>For more technical information about how blocking works, please read <a href=\"https://blog.mozilla.org/addons/2020/08/24/introducing-a-scalable-add-ons-blocklist/\">Introducing a scalable add-ons blocklist</a> on the <a href=\"https://blog.mozilla.org/addons/\">Add-ons Blog</a>. \n</p>\n<h1 id=\"w_how-will-i-know-if-an-add-on-is-disabled-by-mozilla\">How will I know if an add-on is disabled by Mozilla?</h1>\n<p>If you suspect you have installed an add-on that has been disabled by Mozilla, you can verify its status by going to the Firefox Add-ons Manager.\nClick the menu button <img alt=\"Fx89menuButton\" class=\"wiki-image frameless lazy\" data-original-src=\"https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/media/uploads/gallery/images/2021-05-15-11-18-38-e5b736.png\" src=\"https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/static/placeholder.688345f843bb37ed.gif\" title=\"\">, click <span class=\"for\" data-for=\"not fx140\"><span class=\"menu\">Add-ons and themes</span></span><span class=\"for\" data-for=\"fx140\"><span class=\"menu\">Extensions and themes</span></span> and select <span class=\"menu\">Extensions</span>.\n Any disabled extensions will appear in the <em>Disabled</em> section.
